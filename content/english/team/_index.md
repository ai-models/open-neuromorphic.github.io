- description: Henning Wessels is Assistant Professor at the Department of Civil and
    Environmental Engineering, Technical University Braunschweig, where he is leading
    the data-driven modeling group. His group is developing computational methods
    at the intersection of mechanics, numerics, machine learning and uncertainty quantification.
    Applications can be found, for instance, in virtual sensing and structural health
    monitoring. Here, SNN offer huge potential for data-driven mechanics on neuromorphic
    hardware within embedded systems.

- description: 'Jens Egholm Pedersen is a doctoral student at the [Royal Institute of
    Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/profile/jeped/) working to model and construct
    [neuromorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering) control
    systems.


    When faced with the complexity and ambiguity in the real world, contemporary algorithms
    fail spectacularly. There is a strong need for self-correcting, closed-loop systems
    to help solve our everyday physical problems.


    By simulating and carefully scrutinizing and understanding neural circuits, including
    vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, Jens seeks to build autonomous systems
    that perform meaningful work, tightly following the Feynman axiom ''What I cannot
    create, I do not understand''.

- description: 'Melika Payvand is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Neuroinformatics,
    University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. She received her PhD in Electrical and Computer
    Engineering at the University of California Santa Barbara.


    Her recent research interest is in developing on-device learning systems that
    form themselves to the sensory input in a real-time fashion.  Specifically, she
    exploits the physics of resistive memory for synaptic, neuronal, dendritic and
    structural plasticity, inspired by the structure-function relationship of the
    brain circuits.


    Melika is the recipient of the 2023 “Swiss ERC” starting grant and ''Best Neuromorph''
    award at 2019 Telluride workshop. She has co-coordinated the European project
    [NEUROTECH](https://neurotechai.eu), is the program co-chair of the International
    Conference on Neuromorphic Systems (ICONS) and co-organizes the scientific program
    of the Capocaccia Neuromorphic Intelligence workshop.'

- description: 'Charlotte Frenkel is an Assistant Professor at the Microelectronics
    department of Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.


    Her research goals are:

    - to demonstrate a competitive advantage for neuromorphic computing devices compared
    to conventional neural network accelerators,

    - to uncover a framework toward on-chip neuromorphic intelligence for adaptive
    edge computing.


    To achieve these goals, she is investigating both the bottom-up and the top-down
    design approaches, as well as their synergies.

    She is the designer of the [ODIN](https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ODIN) and [ReckOn](https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ReckOn)

    research group at the new [CogniGron](https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/cognitive-systems-and-materials/about/)
    center for cognitive systems and materials in Groningen. He is funded by the European
    [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk/) research network.


    In his PhD, he works with different neuromorphic systems ([Loihi 2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/neuromorphic-computing.html),
    [DynapSE2](https://www.synsense.ai/products/dynap-se2/), and [photonic reservoirs](https://photonics.intec.ugent.be/research/topics.asp?ID=112))
    to develop programming methods for devices that explore a richer set of physical
    dynamics than the synchronous bi-stable switching that (most of) computer science
    relies on. Steve''s background is in computer science and machine learning, with
    a touch of physics.'

    Team at the European Space Agency. His research efforts are focused on retinomorphic
    vision as well as the interplay between homeostasis, adaptation, axon guidance
    and structural plasticity in spiking neural networks.


    No single branch of AI can claim the crown of true intelligence on its own. Rather,
    developing AI worthy of the ''I'' would require a concerted effort to combine
    virtually all the branches - from perception through learning and cognition to
    reasoning and interaction. The most enticing aspect of neuromorphic computing
    is its potential to bring about this unification.'

- description: 'Gregor Lenz graduated with a Ph.D. in neuromorphic engineering from
    Sorbonne University. He thinks that technology can learn a thing or two from how
    biological systems process information.


    His main interests are event cameras that are inspired by the human retina and
    spiking neural networks that mimic human brain in an effort to teach machines
    to compute a bit more like humans do. At the very least there are some power efficiency
    gains to be made, but hopefully more! Also he loves to build open source software
    for spike-based machine learning.

    computing, [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) and [expelliarmus](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus).'
